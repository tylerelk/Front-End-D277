        <h4 class="section-paragraph-header">California</h4>
        <p class="section-paragraph">
            California is a state in the Western United States, lying on the American Pacific Coast. It borders Oregon to the north, Nevada and Arizona to the east, and the Mexican state of Baja California to the south. With 39 million residents across an area of 163,696 square miles, it is the most populous U.S. state, the third-largest by area, and most populated subnational entity in North America. The Greater Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas are the nation's second- and fifth-most populous urban regions, with 19 million and 10 million residents respectively. Los Angeles is the state's most populous city and the nation's second-most, after New York. California's capital, Sacramento, is located in the Central Valley.

        <h4 class="section-paragraph-header">Cultural Contributions</h4>
        <aside>Fortune cookies were originally invented in Northern California!</aside>
        <p class="section-paragraph">
            Notable contributions to popular culture, ranging from entertainment, sports, music, and fashion, have their origins in California. The state has made contributions in communication, information, innovation, education, environmentalism, entertainment, economics, politics, technology, and religion. California is the home of Hollywood, the oldest and one of the largest film industries in the world, profoundly influencing global entertainment. It is the point of origin of hippie counterculture, blue jeans, the internet, the personal computer, Barbie, and skateboarding, among other inventions. The San Francisco Bay and the Greater Los Angeles areas are seen as the centers of the global technology and U.S. film industries, respectively.

        <h4 class="section-paragraph-header">Geography</h4>
        <aside>California experiences over 100,000 earthquakes per year on average</aside>
        <p class="section-paragraph">
            The state's diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast and metropolitan areas in the west to the Sierra Nevada mountains in the east, and from the redwood and Douglas fir forests in the northwest to the Mojave Desert in the southeast. Two-thirds of the nation's earthquake risk lies in California. The Central Valley, a fertile agricultural area, dominates the state's center. California is known for its warm Mediterranean climate along the coast and monsoon seasonal weather inland. The large size of the state results in climates that vary from moist temperate rainforest in the north to arid desert in the interior, as well as snowy alpine in the mountains. Droughts and wildfires are an ongoing issue.
